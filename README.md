## Data analysis basic with Python
Pythion Basics, Statistics basic, Linear Algebra and Python Package like Numpy, Pandas and working with Jupyter notebook
## Data visualization & EDA
packages like seaborn, matplotlib, bokeh and then we'll move to Exploratory Data analysis, something that as a Data Scientist you will need to do on a day-to-day basis
## Machine Learning Foundation
Machine Learning- Foundation is designed to introduce you to Machine Learning basics and then introduce you to most popular Machine Learning algorithms
## Machine Learning Intermediate
Machine Learning Intermediate takes you deeper into Machine Learning through Supervised and Unsupervised algorithms.
## ML Basics for AI
##  Machine Learning Advanced
Advanced Machine Learning techniques like building recommendation engines, neural networks etc
## Tensorflow/Pytorch/fast.ai for Deep Learning Advanced
Deep Learning is the foundation of Artificial Intelligence and this term is perfect for those who are looking to build strong foundations in Deep Learning and want to get started with Tensorflow, the most popular Deep learning framework
## Capstone Project
