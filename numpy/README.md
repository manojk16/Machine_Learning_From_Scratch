- NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array
- It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers.
- In NumPy dimensions are called axes
- For example, the coordinates of a point in 3D space [1, 2, 1] has one axis. That axis has 3 elements in it, so we say it has a length of 3. In the example pictured below, the array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2, the second axis has a length of 3.
[[ 1., 0., 0.],
 [ 0., 1., 2.]]

- NumPy’s array class is called ndarray. It is also known by the alias array.
- The more important attributes of an ndarray object are:
  # ndarray.ndim
      the number of axes (dimensions) of the array.
  # ndarray.shape
      the total number of elements of the array. This is equal to the product of the elements of shape.
  # ndarray.dtype
      an object describing the type of the elements in the array, numpy.int32, numpy.int16, and numpy.float64 are some examples.
  # ndarray.itemsize
      the size in bytes of each element of the array. For example, an array of elements of type float64 has itemsize 8 (=64/8), while one of type complex32 has itemsize 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to ndarray.dtype.itemsize.

## Array Creation
- Using array function, array function will take a single list of numbers as argument
- array transform sequence of sequence in to 2D arrays, sequences of sequences of sequences into three-dimensional arrays, and so on.
- The type of the array can also be explicitly specified at creation time
- The function zeros((R,C)) creates an array full of zeros.
- The function ones creates an array full of ones.
- Function empty creates an array whose initial content is random and depends on the state of the memory. By default, the dtype of the created array is float64.
- To create sequences of numbers, NumPy provides a function(arange(d1,d2)) analogous to range that returns arrays instead of lists.
- When arange is used with floating point arguments, it is generally not possible to predict the number of elements obtained, due to the finite floating point precision. 
- For this reason, it is usually better to use the function linspace that receives as an argument the number of elements that we want, instead of the step

## Basic Operation 
- Substraction a-b
- Square a**b
- Conditional opearation 
- Element wise product a*b
- Matrx product a@b
- *= and += operation are used to modify the exting array
- Uniary Opearion sum are used to find out sum of all element in to the array 
- min() used to find out the minium 
- max()used to find out max
- Sum of each column and row
- min or max of each column and row 
- cumulative sum along each row 
- sin ,cos,exp and sqrt are the universal function 
- Indexing, Slicing and Iterating
	One-dimensional arrays can be indexed, sliced and iterated over, much like lists and other Python sequences
	Multidimensional arrays can have one index per axis. These indices are given in a tuple separated by commas
	Iterating over multidimensional arrays is done with respect to the first axis
## Indexing,Slicing and Iterating
- One-dimensional arrays can be indexed, sliced and iterated over, much like lists and other Python sequences
- Multidimensional arrays can have one index per axis. These indices are given in a tuple separated by commas
- When fewer indices are provided than the number of axes, the missing indices are considered complete slices
- The dots (...) represent as many colons as needed to produce a complete indexing tuple. For example, if x is an array with 5 axes, then.
##                                                        
	x[1,2,...] is equivalent to x[1,2,:,:,:],
	x[...,3] to x[:,:,:,:,3] and
	x[4,...,5,:] to x[4,:,:,5,:].
## Shape manupulation(Changing the shape of an array)
- An array has a shape given by the number of elements along each axis:
- Some method change the exiting array some leave remain same
## Splitting one array into several smaller ones
